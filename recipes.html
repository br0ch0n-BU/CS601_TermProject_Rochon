        <h3>Kale Mango Smoothie</h3>

          I usually drink this smoothie every morning. It's very tasty and
          refreshing! If you don't like eating your greens, this is a good way
          to get your daily dose, as the fruit dominates the flavor of this
          smoothie. Adding some flavorless protein powder further fortifies the
          natural nutrition provided by the fruits and vegetables.

        <h3>Smoked Brisket</h3>
        <img class="float-left" src="assets/images/brisket.jpg" alt="picture of yummy smoked brisket" />
        <p>
          Nothing's yummier than a slow smoked beef brisket with a tasty crispy
          bark! It's very easy to do provided you own a smoker. The only
          challenges are the waiting time and bringing enough friends over to
          eat the massive pile of meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can eat it sliced with BBQ sauce or make little sliders using
          bread rolls.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe is taken mostly from <a href="https://www.traeger.com/recipes/traeger-brisket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traeger</a>,
            though I only sometimes use the foil.</p>

        <p>
          Trim the most absurd fat from the brisket, but leave plenty for
          flavor! Slather both sides of the brisket with olive oil and
          seasoning. Wrap the brisket in plastic wrap and let chill in the
          fridge overnight. The next day, heat smoker to 225&deg; and throw on
          grill, fat side up for approximately 10 hours or until probe reads
          204&deg;. Slice and enjoy!
