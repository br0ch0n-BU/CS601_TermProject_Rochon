      <p>
        Aloha! I'm <a href="https://github.com/br0ch0n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">br0ch0n</a>. I spend a great deal of time being a Software
        Engineer, but my real passion is learning new things and sharing them with others. I really enjoy cooking and
        eating, as well as home improvement projects (though I may just like excuses to hoard power tools). I find that
        the satisfaction of making things yourself balances out the pain one must go through of learning by trial and
        error.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy playing <a href="https://usa.rugby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rugby</a>. While I'm mostly retired from the sport, I still
        play "touch" rugby weekly and real rugby at least twice a year.
