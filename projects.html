          <p>
            I like playing with power tools and trying to get better with them.
            Here I'd like to showcase a few of my home improvement projects and
            the steps involved.

            <h3>Master Bath Door Install</h3>
            <p>
              One of the benefits of living in a 90's tract house is that we
              have a master suite with ensuite bathroom. However it was annoying
              that there was no way to divide the bathroom from the rest of the
              bedroom. We had a curtain up but it felt unprofessional. The
              solution was to finally put a door in the spot where there should
              have been one all along.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of the other doors in the house had been recently replaced
              during a remodel, so it was easy to find a matching door for this
              project.

            <p>There weren't too many steps for this project:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Build wood framing above doorway to normal door height.</li>
              <li>
                Install door jamb (the door came pre-hung) in new door-sized
                opening.
              </li>
              <li>Move the heater vent over a few inches.</li>
              <li>Drywall over the upper framing.</li>
              <li>Cut and install trim moulding.</li>
              <li>Caulk, texture, and paint everything.</li>
              <li>Put the doors on the hinges.</li>

            <h3>Downstairs Bath Remodel</h3>

            <p>
              This one was lots of work! I budgeted a few weeks but it ended up
              taking me six months. The downstairs bath is the one that guests
              see, so I had a grand vision of what I wanted it to look like. The
              main goal was for it to match the faux-craftsman motif of the rest
              of the house.
            </p>
            <p>
              This took so long because there were many hidden tedious steps
              like rerouting plumbing and electrical on top of the normal
              remodel work. I ended up buying lots of new tools.

              <li>
